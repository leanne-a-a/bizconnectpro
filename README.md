# Our final group project for CST 255 is a database and connected website for use by business in updating their employee and departmental records.
# We used HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to create a site which accepts input and validates errors. The site structure allows for all features of CRUD.
# Future iterations might include expanding the range of allowable information, and dynamically updating to better fit our clientele.
